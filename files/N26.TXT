overcome fading of the transmitted signal 

ensure that the radiated signal has the intended polarisation 

transfer maximum power to the antenna 

% ans 4

%Question: 9
#26.9 A damaged antenna or feedline attached to the output of a transmitter 
will present an incorrect load resulting in: 

the driver stage not delivering power to the final 

the output tuned circuit breaking down 

excessive heat being produced in the transmitter output stage 

loss of modulation in the transmitted signal 

% ans 3

%Question: 10 
#26.10 A result of mismatch between the power amplifier of a transmitter and

%Question: 11
#26.11 Losses occurring on a transmission line between a transmitter and 
antenna result in: 

less RF power being radiated 

a SWR of 1:1 

reflections occurring in the line 

improved transfer of RF energy to the antenna 

% ans 1

%Question: 12
#26.12 If the characteristic impedance of a feedline does not match the antenna 
input impedance then: 

standing waves are produced in the feedline 

heat is produced at the junction 

the SWR drops to 1:1 

the antenna will not radiate any signal 

% ans 1

%Question: 13
#26.13 A result of standing waves on a non-resonant transmission line is:
