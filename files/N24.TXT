%QUESTION: 1
#24.1 You are mobile and talking through a VHF repeater. The other station reports that you keep 
"dropping out". This means: 

your signal is drifting lower in frequency 

your signal does not have enough strength to operate the repeater 

your voice is too low-pitched to be understood 

you are not speaking loudly enough 

% ans 2 

%QUESTION: 2 
#24.2 A "pileup" is: 

an old, worn-out radio 

another name for a junkbox 

a large group of stations all calling the same DX station 

a type of selenium rectifier 

% ans 3 

%QUESTION: 3 
#24.3 "Break-in keying" means: 

unauthorised entry has resulted in station equipment disappearing 

temporary emergency operating 

key-down changes the station to transmit, key-up to receive 

the other station's keying is erratic 

% ans 3 

%QUESTION: 4 
#24.4 A repeater operating with a "positive 600 kHz split": 

listens on a frequency 600 kHz higher than its designated frequency 

transmits on a frequency 600 kHz higher than its designated frequency 

transmits simultaneously on its designated frequency and one 600 kHz higher 

uses positive modulation with a bandwidth of 600 kHz 

% ans 1 

%QUESTION: 5 
#24.5 The standard frequency offset (split) for 2 metre repeaters in New Zealand is: 

plus 600 kHz above 147 MHz, minus 600 kHz on or below 147 MHz 

plus 600 kHz below 147 MHz, minus 600 kHz on or above 147 MHz 

minus 5 MHz below 147 MHz, plus 5 MHz kHz on or above 147 MHz 

plus 5 MHz below 147 MHz, minus 5 MHz kHz on or above 147 MHz 

% ans 1 

%QUESTION: 6 
#24.6 The standard frequency offset (split) for 70 cm repeaters in New Zealand is plus or minus: 

600 kHz

% ans 4 

%QUESTION: 7 
#24.7 You are adjusting an antenna matching unit using an SWR bridge. You should adjust for: 

maximum reflected power 

equal reflected and transmitted power 

minimum reflected power 

minimum transmitted power 

% ans 3 

%QUESTION: 8 
#24.8 The "squelch" or "muting" circuitry on a VHF receiver: 

inhibits the audio output unless a station is being received 

compresses incoming voice signals to make them more intelligible 

reduces audio burst noise due to lightning emissions 

reduces the noise on incoming signals 

% ans 1 

%QUESTION: 9 
#24.9 The "S meter" on a receiver: 

indicates where the squelch control should be set 

indicates the standing wave ratio 

indicates the state of the battery voltage 

indicates relative incoming signal strengths 

% ans 4 

%QUESTION: 10 
#24.10 The "National System" is: 

the legal licensing standard of Amateur operation in New Zealand 

a series of nationwide amateur radio linked repeaters in the 70 cm band 

the official New Zealand repeater band plan 

A nationwide emergency communications procedure 

% ans 2 

%QUESTION: 11 
#24.11 A noise blanker on a receiver is most effective to reduce: 

50 Hz power supply hum 

noise originating from the mixer stage of the receiver 

ignition noise 

noise originating from the RF stage of the receiver. 

% ans 3 

%QUESTION: 12 
#24.12 The purpose of a VOX unit in a transceiver is to: 

change from receiving to transmitting using the sound of the operator's voice 

check the transmitting frequency using the voice operated crystal 

enable a volume operated extension speaker for remote listening 

enable the variable oscillator crystal 

% ans 1 

%QUESTION: 13

random interference tester 

% ans 3 

%QUESTION: 15 
#24.15 The "RIT" control on a transceiver: 

reduces interference on the transmission 

changes the frequency of the transmitter section without affecting the frequency of the receiver section 

changes the transmitting and receiver frequencies by the same amount 

changes the frequency of the receiver section without affecting the frequency of the transmitter section 

% ans 4 

%QUESTION: 16 
#24.16 The "split frequency" function on a transceiver allows the operator to: 

transmit on one frequency and receive on another 

monitor two frequencies simultaneously using a single loudspeaker 

monitor two frequencies simultaneously using two loudspeakers 

receive CW and SSB signals simultaneously on the same frequency 

% ans 1 

%QUESTION: 17
