%Question 1
#2.1 Amateur stations are often regarded as "frequency agile". This means: 

operation is limited to frequency modulation 

operators can choose to operate anywhere on a shared band 

a bandswitch is required on all transceivers 

on a shared band operators can change frequency to avoid interfering 

% ans 4

%Question 2
#2.2 A new amateur radio operator is permitted to: 

operate on all amateur bands other than VHF at least weekly using a computer for log-keeping 

operate only on specified amateur bands for 3 months logging at least 50 contacts and retaining the log book for at least one year for possible official inspection 

operate only on one fixed frequency in the amateur bands between 5 and 25 MHz for 6 months and then present the log book for official inspection 

operate on amateur bands between 5 and 25 MHz as and when the operator chooses
