%Question: 1 
#13.1 An ohmmeter measures the: 

value of any resistance placed between its terminals 

impedance of any component placed between its terminals 

power factor of any inductor or capacitor placed between its terminals 

voltage across any resistance placed between its terminals 

% ans 1

%Question: 2 
#13.2 A VSWR meter switched to the "reverse" position provides an indication 
of: 

power output in watts 

relative reflected voltage 

relative forward voltage 

reflected power in dB 

% ans 2

%Question: 2 
#13.3 The correct instrument for measuring the supply current to an amplifier 
is a: 

wattmeter 

voltmeter 

ammeter 

ohmmeter 

% ans 3

%Question: 4 
#13.4 The following meter could be used to measure the power supply current 
drawn by a small hand-held transistorised receiver: 

a power meter 

an RF ammeter 

a DC ammeter 

an electrostatic voltmeter 

% ans 3

%Question: 5 
#13.5 When measuring the current drawn by a light bulb from a DC supply, the 
meter will act in circuit as: 

an insulator 

a low value resistance 

a perfect conductor 

an extra current drain 

% ans 2

%Question: 6 
#13.6 When measuring the current drawn by a receiver from a power supply, the 
current meter should be placed: 

in parallel with both receiver power supply leads 

in parallel with one of the receiver power leads 

in series with both receiver power leads 

in series with one of the receiver power leads 

% ans 4

%Question: 7 
#13.7 An ammeter should not be connected directly across the terminals of a 12 
volt car battery because: 

the resulting high current will probably destroy the ammeter 

no current will flow because no other components are in the circuit 

the battery voltage will be too low for a measurable current to flow 

the battery voltage will be too high for a measurable current to flow 

% ans 1

%Question: 8 
#13.8 A good ammeter should have: 

a very high internal resistance 

a resistance equal to that of all other components in the circuit 

a very low internal resistance 

an infinite resistance 

% ans 3

%Question: 9 
#13.9 A good voltmeter should have: 

a very high internal resistance 

a resistance equal to that of all other components in the circuit 

a very low internal resistance 

an inductive reactance 

% ans 1

%Question: 10 
#13.10 An rms-reading voltmeter is used to measure a 50 Hz sinewave of known 
peak voltage 14 volt. The meter reading will be about: 

14 volt 

28 volt 

10 volt 

50 volt 

% ans 3
