#27.40 On VHF and UHF bands, polarisation of the receiving antenna is important 
in relation to the transmitting antenna, but on HF it is relatively unimportant 
because: 

the ionosphere can change the polarisation of the signal from moment to moment 

the ground wave and the sky wave continually shift the polarisation 

anomalies in the earth's magnetic field profoundly affect HF polarisation 

improved selectivity in HF receivers makes changes in polarisation redundant
