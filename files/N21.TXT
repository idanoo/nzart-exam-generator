%Question: 9
#21.9 The output voltage of a DC power supply decreases when current is drawn from it because: 

drawing output current causes the input mains voltage to decrease 

drawing output current causes the input mains frequency to decrease 

all power supplies have some internal resistance 

some power is reflected back into the mains. 

% ans 3
