%QUESTION: 1
#19.1 Morse code is usually transmitted by radio as: 

an interrupted carrier 

a voice modulated carrier 

a continuous carrier 

a series of clicks 

% ans 1

%QUESTION: 2 
#19.2 To obtain high frequency stability in a transmitter, the VFO should be: 

run from a non-regulated AC supply 

in a plastic box 

powered from a regulated DC supply 

able to change frequency with temperature 

% ans 3 

%QUESTION: 3 
#19.3 SSB transmissions: 

occupy about twice the bandwidth of AM transmissions 

contain more information than AM transmissions 

occupy about half the bandwidth of AM transmissions 

are compatible with FM transmissions 

% ans 3 

%QUESTION: 4 
#19.4 The purpose of a balanced modulator in a SSB transmitter is to: 

make sure that the carrier and both sidebands are in phase 

make sure that the carrier and both sidebands are 180 degrees out of phase 

ensure that the percentage of modulation is kept constant 

suppress the carrier while producing two sidebands 

% ans 4 

%QUESTION: 5 
#19.5 Several stations advise that your FM simplex transmission in the "two metre" band is 
distorted. The cause might be that: 

the transmitter modulation deviation is too high 

your antenna is too low 

the transmitter has become unsynchronised 

your transmitter frequency split is incorrect 

% ans 1 

%QUESTION: 6 
#19.6 The driver stage of a transmitter is located: 

before the power amplifier 

between oscillator and buffer 

with the frequency multiplier 

after the output low-pass filter circuit 

% ans 1 

%QUESTION: 7 
#19.7 The purpose of the final amplifier in a transmitter is to: 

increase the frequency of a signal 

isolate the multiplier and later stages 

produce a stable radio frequency 

increase the power fed to the antenna 

% ans 4 

%QUESTION: 8 
#19.8 The difference between DC input power and RF power output of a transmitter RF amplifier: 

radiates from the antenna 

is dissipated as heat 

is lost in the feedline 

is due to oscillating current 

% ans 2 

%QUESTION: 9 
#19.9 The process of modulation allows: 

information to be impressed on to a carrier 

information to be removed from a carrier 

voice and Morse code to be combined 

none of these 

% ans 1 

%QUESTION: 10 
#19.10 The output power rating of a linear amplifier in a SSB transmitter is specified by the: 

peak DC input power 

mean AC input power 

peak envelope power 

unmodulated carrier power 

% ans 3
